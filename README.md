# RoomDBRelationships

Relational Databases defines Relationships between tables.
The can be 
1. One to One Relationships
2. One to N Relationships
3. N to M Relationships

In this Demo 
1. School and Director is having One to One Relationship
2. School and Student is having One to N Relationship
3. Student and Subject is having N to M Relationship.

We need to create an Extra table for N-M Relationship which need to contain primary keys of both Entities involved in the relation ship.
